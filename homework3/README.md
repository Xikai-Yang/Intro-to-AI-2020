## Homework3 Digit-Recognizer

This homework asks us to finish the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer using at least one deep learning technique(CNN).Besides, we are encouraged to try different models(like ANN/RNN/LSTM).

The Kaggle competition platform has the classic task of Digit Recognizer, and provides tens of thousands of handwritten digital photos of grayscale data. <br>
At present, this task has been perfectly solved by artificial intelligence programs designed by many scientific researchers, achieving 100% test accuracy.<br> 
After you are familiar with the use of the Kaggle platform, please directly complete the Digit Recognizer competition task through the platform, and compete with first-line scientists.<br>
