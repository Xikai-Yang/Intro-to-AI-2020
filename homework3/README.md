## Homework3 Digit-Recognizer

This homework asks us to finish the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

    The Kaggle competition platform has the classic task of Digit Recognizer, and provides tens of thousands of handwritten digital photos of grayscale data (photos can be restored with the help of Matlab). At present, this task has been perfectly solved by artificial intelligence programs designed by many scientific researchers, achieving 100% test accuracy. After you are familiar with the use of the Kaggle platform, please directly complete the Digit Recognizer competition task through the platform, and compete with first-line scientists; take a screenshot of your experience, experimental process, and best evaluation results during the competition Write the experiment report, and submit your code in the appendix
